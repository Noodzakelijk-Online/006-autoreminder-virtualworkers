# Technology Stack Selection for AutoReminder Desktop Application

After analyzing the requirements for the Windows executable version of AutoReminder with a modern UI, I've evaluated several technology options and selected the most appropriate stack.

## Requirements Analysis

1. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Primary focus on Windows 11, but maintaining web version
2. **Full feature parity**: All features from web version must be available
3. **Modern UI**: Contemporary dark theme with purple accents, card-based layout
4. **Integrations**: Trello, Email, SMS/WhatsApp
5. **Database**: Both local and cloud options
6. **Authentication**: Trello account login required

## Technology Options Considered

### 1. Electron
**Pros:**
- Excellent for web code reuse (React, Node.js)
- Mature ecosystem with strong community support
- Cross-platform capabilities
- Seamless integration with web APIs
- Straightforward packaging for Windows (.exe)
- Familiar development experience for web developers

**Cons:**
- Larger application size
- Higher memory usage
- Not as performant as native solutions

### 2. Tauri
**Pros:**
- Smaller application size
- Better performance than Electron
- Modern Rust backend
- Cross-platform capabilities

**Cons:**
- Less mature ecosystem
- More complex for certain integrations
- Steeper learning curve
- Smaller community support

### 3. .NET MAUI
**Pros:**
- Native Windows performance
- Good UI capabilities with WinUI
- Strong Microsoft ecosystem

**Cons:**
- Limited code reuse from web version
- Primarily focused on Windows
- Requires C# knowledge
- More complex deployment for web version

## Selected Technology Stack

**Electron** is the optimal choice for this project because:

1. **Code Reuse**: Allows maximum reuse of existing React frontend and Node.js backend code
2. **Integration Support**: Excellent support for Trello API, email services, and other integrations
3. **Database Flexibility**: Can work with both local (SQLite) and cloud (MongoDB) databases
4. **UI Capabilities**: Strong support for modern UI frameworks like Material UI or Tailwind CSS
5. **Authentication**: Seamless integration with Trello OAuth
6. **Development Speed**: Fastest path to a feature-complete Windows application
7. **Packaging**: Well-established tools for creating Windows executables

## Implementation Plan

1. **Frontend**: React with Material UI (styled to match reference design)
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express (same as web version)
3. **Database**: SQLite for local storage, MongoDB for cloud storage
4. **Authentication**: Trello OAuth integration
5. **Packaging**: Electron Forge for creating Windows executable

This technology stack will enable us to create a Windows executable that maintains all the functionality of the web version while providing a modern, native-feeling desktop experience.
